# Coders Factory - Programming Learning Platform

Coders Factory is a comprehensive programming learning platform aimed at providing hands-on practice for aspiring programmers, particularly junior developers. Our platform focuses on practical learning, allowing users to build their skills through real-world coding scenarios.

## Features

- **Career Path Selection**: Users can choose their desired career path, such as Java Developer, Python Engineer, or Web Developer. This allows them to tailor their learning experience to their specific goals and interests.

- **Virtual Company Offers**: Once a career path is selected, users receive virtual job offers from companies looking to hire individuals in their chosen field. This provides an immersive learning environment where users can apply their skills to realistic scenarios.

- **Personalized CV Development**: Upon accepting a virtual job offer, users are assigned a blank CV that they need to fill by learning and mastering various programming technologies. As they progress through the platform, their CV gets updated with acquired skills and projects completed.

- **Task-based Learning**: Learning is driven by completing tasks relevant to the selected career path. Users are assigned tasks based on their preferred learning duration. These tasks are generated using advanced AI models like GPT and Jasper, ensuring their relevance and quality.

- **Code Review Marketplace**: Users have the option to have their completed tasks reviewed by AI models or real developers. They can choose to pay a small fee for an AI-driven review or list their task on the Code Review Marketplace, where interested developers can review and provide feedback. Payment transfers occur upon task review completion.

- **Spaced Repetition Learning**: To enhance long-term retention, our platform incorporates a spaced repetition system (SRS) based on the Super Memo algorithm. This algorithm optimizes the timing of task delivery, ensuring users revisit and reinforce concepts, minimizing the chances of forgetting.

- **External Company Contributions**: Real companies can contribute tasks to the platform and create their own profiles and career paths. Users can grant permission for their profiles to be shared with external companies and receive tasks directly from them. This offers opportunities for users to showcase their skills and potentially secure job opportunities.

- **Learning Materials and Preparatory Content**: Before starting a task, users are provided with relevant learning materials, including articles and videos, to familiarize themselves with upcoming topics. This approach supports effective learning and helps users build neural pathways for new concepts.
